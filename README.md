# ansible-oci-scripts

Ansible scripts for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). There is a parallel repository for Terraform scripts at [terraform-oci-scripts](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/terraform-oci-scripts).

There are two (2) initialisation playbooks in this repository:

1. `install_terraform.yml` which installs Terraform on the local computer.
1. `install_oci_ansible.yml` which installs OCI for Ansible on the local computer.
