# 2024-05-21: Installed OCI Ansible Module

## Ansible Playbook to Install OCI Ansible Module

The Ansible playbook, `install_oci_ansible.yml`, returned the following instructions:

```text
        "Installing 'oracle.oci:5.0.0' to '/root/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/oracle/oci'",
        "oracle.oci:5.0.0 was installed successfully",
        "-- Installing latest version of oci-ansible-collection ....",
        "-- Installed oci-ansible-collection successfully...",
        "",
        "-- Run the following command(s) to use the installed oci-ansible-collection",
        "source /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/activate",
        "",
        "-- Try the following command to start using oci-ansible-collection",
        "ansible-doc oracle.oci.oci_network_vcn",
        "",
        "==========================NEXT STEPS====================================",
        "",
        "-- Configure authentication to manage and access Oracle Cloud resources using oci-ansible-collection",
        "",
        "Follow the link to know more about the configuration setup:",
        "https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/ansiblegetstarted.htm#configureAuth."
```

## Post-Installation Steps

When I tried to run these steps:

```bash
source /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/activate
```

The following error message was returned:

```text
source: permission denied: /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/activate
```

Rerunning the command as `root`, I get the following prompt:

```text
(oci-ansible-collection) root@coogee:~#
```

However when I try to run the following command,

```bash
ansible-doc oracle.oci.oci_network_vcn
```

I get the following message:

```text
-bash: /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/ansible-doc: /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
```

This was fixed by:

```bash
ln -sf $(realpath $(which python3)) /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/python
```

## Allow Everyone to Activate OCI-Ansible Collection

I ran the following command to create a generally available command to activate OCI-Ansible collection:

```bash
sudo cp /root/lib/oci-ansible-collection/bin/activate /usr/bin/activate-oci-ansible
```

## Update Shell Initialisation Scripts

I ran the following commands to update the shell initialisation scripts:

```bash
cat >>~/.zshrc <<DONE
source activate-oci-ansible
DONE
cat >>~/.bash_rc <<DONE
source activate-oci-ansible
DONE
```
